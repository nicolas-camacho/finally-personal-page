This project was created to help me understand how to use some technologies that I was not familiar with,
such as Docker and Playwright.

The main idea idea is not my own, I just translated the original website to spanish.
The interesting part is how the content is being translated, using the GPT-3 API, and also
how powerfull is Next JS to create a simple API that could be used by the frontend.

you can check the original website here: [Should I Deploy](https://shouldideploy.today/)
